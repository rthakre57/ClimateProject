      <h2>Climate vs. Weather</h2>
      <p>
        Climate and weather are related but distinct concepts. <strong>Weather</strong> refers to the short-term atmospheric conditions at a specific place and time, including variables such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind. In contrast, <strong>climate</strong> represents the long-term average of weather patterns over extended periods—typically 30 years or more—and covers broader spatial scales. Understanding this distinction is crucial for interpreting climate models, which aim to predict long-term trends rather than immediate weather events.

      <h2>Key Components of Earth’s Climate System</h2>
      <p>The Earth's climate system consists of several interacting components, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> The layer of gases surrounding the Earth, where weather and many climate processes occur.</li>
        <li><strong>Hydrosphere:</strong> All water bodies, including oceans, lakes, and rivers, which store and transport heat and moisture.</li>
        <li><strong>Cryosphere:</strong> Frozen parts of the Earth such as glaciers, ice caps, and sea ice, which influence albedo and sea levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Lithosphere:</strong> The Earth's solid surface, including landforms and soils, affecting energy absorption and emissions.</li>
        <li><strong>Biosphere:</strong> All living organisms, which interact with climate through processes such as photosynthesis and respiration.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These components interact in complex ways to produce the observed climate patterns and variability.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Drivers of Climate Change</h2>
      <p>Climate change is driven by various natural and anthropogenic factors, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Solar Radiation Variability:</strong> Changes in the sun’s output affecting the Earth’s energy balance.</li>
        <li><strong>Volcanic Activity:</strong> Emission of aerosols and gases that can temporarily cool the atmosphere.</li>
        <li><strong>Greenhouse Gas Concentrations:</strong> Levels of gases such as CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O that trap heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Land Use Changes:</strong> Deforestation, urbanization, and agriculture altering surface reflectivity and carbon sinks.</li>
        <li><strong>Ocean Circulation Changes:</strong> Shifts in currents affecting heat distribution globally.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Anthropogenic Influences</h2>
      <p>Human activities have significantly altered the natural balance of the climate system. Major anthropogenic influences include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fossil Fuel Combustion:</strong> Release of large quantities of CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gases.</li>
        <li><strong>Industrial Processes:</strong> Emissions of pollutants and aerosols impacting atmospheric chemistry.</li>
        <li><strong>Deforestation and Land Degradation:</strong> Reduction in carbon sequestration capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>Agricultural Practices:</strong> Methane emissions from livestock and rice paddies.</li>
        <li><strong>Waste Management:</strong> Release of potent greenhouse gases like methane from landfills.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These influences have led to accelerated global warming and associated climate impacts.</p>
