  <section>
    <h2>Governing Equations</h2>

    <article>
      <h3>Differential Equations in Climate Modeling</h3>
      <p>Climate models are grounded in <span class="highlight">differential equations</span> that describe how climate variables evolve over time and space. These include equations derived from the conservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy. <span class="highlight">Partial differential equations (PDEs)</span> are widely used to simulate atmospheric and oceanic flows, incorporating processes like advection, diffusion, and phase transitions.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Heat and Mass Transfer Equations</h3>
      <p>Heat transfer in the climate system occurs through conduction, convection, and radiation. The <span class="highlight">heat equation</span> is used to model temperature distribution:</p>
      <div class="code">
        <p>
 	 \[
	  \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \alpha \nabla^2 T
  	\]
	</p>

      </div>
      <p>where <span class="highlight">T</span> is temperature and <span class="highlight">α</span> is thermal diffusivity. Similarly, mass transfer equations model the transport of substances like water vapor and CO<sub>2</sub>, crucial for understanding atmospheric composition and energy balance.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Carbon Cycle Modeling</h2>
    <article>
      <p>The carbon cycle involves dynamic interactions between the atmosphere, biosphere, oceans, and lithosphere. Mathematical models include <span class="highlight">box models</span> and systems of differential equations that describe carbon fluxes and storage. These help assess the impact of fossil fuel emissions, deforestation, and ocean uptake on atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels.</p>
    </article>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Ocean-Atmosphere Interaction Models</h2>
    <article>
      <p>Interactions between the ocean and atmosphere drive climate variability. Models simulate the exchange of heat, gases, and momentum across the air-sea interface. Key phenomena modeled include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)</li>
        <li>Thermohaline circulation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These are represented through coupled systems of PDEs that are solved numerically to capture complex feedbacks and time evolution.</p>
    </article>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Coupled Subsystems and Integrated Models</h2>
    <article>
      <p>Integrated models combine the atmosphere, oceans, cryosphere, and terrestrial systems into a single framework. These <span class="highlight">coupled climate models</span> solve multiple equations simultaneously to account for feedback loops and interdependencies. This integrated approach is essential for robust long-term climate forecasting and impact assessments.</p>
