    <h1>Chapter 1: Introduction</h1>

    <h2>1.1 Background and Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of the 21st century, with significant implications for ecosystems, economies, and human societies. Understanding the complex interplay of natural and anthropogenic factors contributing to global climate variability requires robust analytical tools. Mathematical modeling provides a powerful framework for simulating and predicting climate dynamics, offering insights into potential future scenarios based on various assumptions and interventions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The motivation behind this study is to apply a systems approach to climate modeling — integrating different subsystems such as the atmosphere, oceans, and carbon cycle — to better understand how feedback mechanisms and external forcings influence long-term climate behavior.
    </p>

    <h2>1.2 Objectives of the Study</h2>
    <p>The primary objectives of this study are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To explore the fundamental principles of climate science through a mathematical lens.</li>
      <li>To develop and analyze mathematical models that capture the dynamic behavior of the climate system.</li>
      <li>To simulate future climate scenarios using both deterministic and stochastic models.</li>
      <li>To evaluate the potential impacts of policy measures through integrated assessment modeling.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.3 Scope and Limitations</h2>
    <p>This study focuses on the formulation and analysis of mathematical models that describe climate change dynamics. The models considered range from simple energy balance equations to more complex coupled systems representing ocean-atmosphere interactions.</p>
    <p>The limitations of the study include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reliance on publicly available datasets, which may vary in accuracy and resolution.</li>
      <li>Simplifications and assumptions inherent in model formulation, such as linearization and parameter estimation.</li>
      <li>Computational constraints limiting the resolution and complexity of simulations.</li>
    </ul>
