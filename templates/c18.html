  <h1>Applications and Policy Implications</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Predictive Capabilities of Climate Models</h2>
    <p>Climate models serve as powerful tools to predict future climate changes by simulating the complex interactions within the Earth system. Their predictive capabilities enable:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Estimation of temperature, precipitation, and sea-level rise trends.</li>
      <li>Identification of potential climate extremes and their frequency.</li>
      <li>Assessment of regional and global impacts under various emission scenarios.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Role in International Climate Policy</h2>
    <p>Mathematical climate models underpin international climate negotiations and agreements by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Providing scientifically grounded projections that inform policy targets, such as those in the Paris Agreement.</li>
      <li>Evaluating the effectiveness of emission reduction commitments.</li>
      <li>Facilitating transparency and accountability through scenario analyses.</li>
      <li>Supporting risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses for climate action.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Modeling Mitigation and Adaptation Strategies</h2>
    <p>Climate models assist in designing and evaluating mitigation and adaptation strategies by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Simulating the impacts of renewable energy adoption, carbon capture, and reforestation.</li>
      <li>Assessing vulnerability and resilience of ecosystems and human communities.</li>
      <li>Informing infrastructure planning to cope with climate-related hazards.</li>
      <li>Supporting development of early warning systems and disaster risk management.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs)</h2>
    <p>Integrated Assessment Models combine climate science, economics, and policy analysis to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Quantify the interactions between human and natural systems.</li>
      <li>Evaluate socio-economic impacts of climate change.</li>
      <li>Analyze cost-effectiveness of mitigation and adaptation pathways.</li>
      <li>Support comprehensive policy development with scenario-based insights.</li>
    </ul>
